Use the `stack` agent to manage skill workflows.

**Usage:**
- `/stack` - Show interactive menu
- `/stack build` - Create a new stack through guided questions
- `/stack list` - List all available stacks (personal and project)
- `/stack <name>` - Run a saved stack
- `/stack edit <name>` - Edit an existing stack

The stack agent handles all workflow operations including building, running, editing, and listing stacks.
